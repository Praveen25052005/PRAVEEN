1. Importing Libraries
The program imports pandas (pd), which is a powerful data manipulation library.

2. Defining the File Path
The variable file_path specifies the CSV file (Chocolate Sales.csv) that the program will read.

3. Function: read_csv_in_chunks()
This function reads the CSV file in chunks of 1,000 rows (by default) to efficiently handle large datasets.

It uses a try-except block for error handling.

4. Reading Data in Chunks
The function creates an empty list (chunk_list) to store chunks of the CSV file.

It then iterates over the file, reading 1,000 rows at a time using pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunk_size).

Each chunk is appended to chunk_list, and finally, all chunks are combined into a single DataFrame using pd.concat().

5. Error Handling
FileNotFoundError: Handles cases where the file doesn't exist.

pd.errors.EmptyDataError: Catches errors when the file is empty.

pd.errors.ParserError: Handles CSV formatting errors.

Exception: Catches any unexpected errors and prints the error message.

6. Loading the Data
Calls read_csv_in_chunks() and stores the returned data in df.

If df is not None, it displays:

The first few rows (df.head()).

A summary of the dataset (df.info()), including column details and memory usage.
1. Importing Libraries
The program imports pandas, a powerful tool for handling tabular data.

2. Loading the Dataset
The CSV file (Chocolate Sales.csv) is read using pd.read_csv(file_path), loading it into a DataFrame.

3. Previewing the Data
The first five rows are displayed using df.head(), helping to understand the dataset’s structure.

4. Data Cleaning (clean_data(df))
This function ensures data quality by performing:

Dropping rows with missing values (df.dropna()), avoiding incomplete records.

Removing duplicates (df.drop_duplicates()), preventing double counting.

Converting dates (pd.to_datetime(df_clean['Date'])), ensuring proper date format if a "Date" column exists.

5. Performing Calculations
The program defines three functions to analyze the sales data:

a) Total Sales (total_sales(df))
If a column "Total Sales" exists, it sums up all sales values.

If not, but "Unit Price" and "Quantity Sold" are present, it calculates total sales using Unit Price * Quantity Sold.

If neither condition is met, it returns an error message.

b) Average Price (average_price(df))
Computes the average unit price if the "Unit Price" column exists.

Otherwise, it alerts the user that the column is missing.

c) Sales by Category (sales_by_category(df))
Groups sales data by "Category" and sums up the "Total Sales" for each category.

If the required columns are absent, it returns an error message.

6. Main Execution
The dataset is cleaned using clean_data(df).

Then, total sales, average price, and category-based sales are calculated and displayed.

Why This Program Is Useful
✅ Cleans and preprocesses data for accuracy ✅ Handles missing values and duplicates ✅ Allows flexible calculations based on available data ✅ Provides valuable business insights
1. Importing Required Libraries
The program imports:

numpy: Useful for numerical operations.

sklearn.datasets.load_iris: Loads the Iris dataset (a famous dataset with flower measurements).

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: Splits data into training and test sets.

sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier: A machine learning algorithm that uses multiple decision trees.

sklearn.metrics: Provides tools to evaluate the performance of the model.

2. Loading the Dataset
The Iris dataset is loaded using load_iris(), which contains:

X: The features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

y: The target labels (flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).

3. Splitting the Data
The dataset is divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using train_test_split().

This ensures that the model is trained on one part of the data and tested on another.

4. Creating and Training the Model
A Random Forest Classifier is created (RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)).

It is trained on the training data using model.fit(X_train, y_train).

Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.

5. Making Predictions
After training, the model predicts the flower species for test data (y_pred = model.predict(X_test)).

6. Evaluating the Model
The program calculates:

Accuracy (accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)): Measures the percentage of correct predictions.

Precision (precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average="weighted")): Evaluates how well the model avoids false positives.

Recall (recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average="weighted")): Measures how well the model detects actual positive cases.

Classification Report (classification_report(y_test, y_pred)): Provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Final Output
The model prints accuracy, precision, recall, and a classification report with performance metrics.

1. Overview
The application supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It handles user input and provides appropriate results.

Includes error handling to prevent division by zero.

2. Class: Calculator
This class defines four mathematical operations:

add(a, b): Returns the sum of a and b.

subtract(a, b): Returns the difference between a and b.

multiply(a, b): Returns the product of a and b.

divide(a, b): Returns the quotient of a and b but raises an error if b is zero to prevent division by zero.

3. Function: main()
This function serves as the interactive command-line interface:

Displays a menu of operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).

Takes user input for operation choice (1-4).

Requests two numbers for computation.

Calls the appropriate method based on the user’s choice.

Handles errors (invalid input and division by zero).

Displays the result in a user-friendly format.

4. Error Handling
Division by Zero: If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program raises a ValueError with a custom error message ("Cannot divide by zero.").

Invalid Choice: If the user enters an option other than 1-4, the program prints "Invalid choice!" and exits gracefully.

5. Execution Control
The program starts with if __name__ == "__main__": main(), ensuring that the script runs only when executed directly.

If imported elsewhere, the main() function does not automatically execute.
